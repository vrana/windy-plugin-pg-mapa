It highlights takeoffs with usable wind direction. Colors:

- **yellow**: almost matching direction (tolerance ±10°) or wind 4-8 m/s or wind under 1 m/s from any direction
- **silver**: takeoff orientation unknown, wind speed 0-8 m/s
- **red**: wrong direction or wind over 8 m/s
- **black**: takeoff forbidden for legal reasons
- **white**: wind data not loaded

Other data (such as rain or gusts) is not taken into account.
