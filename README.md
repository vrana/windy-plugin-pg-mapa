![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Navigate to https://www.windy.com/plugins and Open *Paragliding takeoffs in Czechia and Slovakia*.

This plugin displays paragliding takeoffs from https://www.paragliding-mapa.cz/ and highlights takeoffs with usable wind direction. Matching wind direction and wind under 4 m/s displays in green, almost matching direction (tolerance ±10°) or wind over 4 m/s in yellow and wrong direction or wind over 8 m/s in red. Other data (such as rain) is not taken into account. The markers update only if the wind layer is selected.
